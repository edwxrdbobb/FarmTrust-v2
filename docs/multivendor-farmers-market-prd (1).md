# 🛒 Multivendor Farmer’s Market Platform – PRD (Revised)

## TL;DR
We’re building a **Multivendor Farmer’s Market Platform** that allows users to purchase fresh produce directly from various types of farmers. Farmers can create accounts, list their products, and manage sales through the platform. Logistics (pickup and delivery) are managed by the platform. Payments are held in **escrow** until the buyer confirms delivery and satisfaction, at which point funds are released to the farmer. This model builds **trust, transparency**, and inclusivity for diverse agricultural producers.
