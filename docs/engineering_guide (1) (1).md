# Multivendor Farmer's Market Platform: Engineering Guide (Performance & Best Practices)

This guide outlines the technical best practices and performance-focused steps for building the Multivendor Farmer's Market Platform using **Next.js**, **Supabase**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**.

---

## 🛠️ 1. Project Setup & Architecture

### ✅ Initial Setup
- Scaffold the project with `create-next-app`.
- Install and configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
- Set up Supabase client for auth, database, and storage integration.
- Create role-based routing (admin, vendor, buyer).
- Apply the **Service and Repository pattern**:
  - **Service Layer**: Handles business logic.
  - **Repository Layer**: Handles all interactions with Supabase (data access).

### 🧱 Folder Structure Best Practices
```
/src
  /components
  /lib
    /repositories  <-- DB communication logic
    /services       <-- Business logic
  /app
    /admin
    /vendor
    /buyer
  /hooks
  /utils
```

### 🔒 Environment Configuration
- Use `.env.local` for API keys (e.g., Supabase URL and anon/public key).
- NEVER commit secrets; use environment variables and secret management (e.g., Vercel's dashboard).

---

## 🔐 2. Authentication & Authorization

### Supabase Auth Best Practices
- Enable email/password and OTP logins.
- Use RLS (Row Level Security) to ensure users only access their data.
- Assign roles (admin, vendor, user) at registration and store them in metadata.

### Middleware
- Implement middleware in Next.js to restrict access to routes based on user role.
- Use a role check in the middleware to redirect unauthorized access attempts.

---

## 👨‍🌾 3. Vendor Experience

### Vendor Account Features
- Vendors can register and sign in through the dedicated vendor portal.
- After signing in, vendors can:
  - Update their profile (farm name, location, description, contact info).
  - Upload farm logo/photo.
  - Add, edit, or delete produce listings (title, description, quantity, price, images).
  - View order history and statuses.

### Performance Considerations
- Use optimistic UI updates for fast feedback on form submissions.
- Apply image compression before upload to Supabase Storage.
- Paginate product listings on the dashboard.

### Service & Repository Responsibilities
- **VendorService**: Handles logic like validating produce input, calculating commissions, or profile completion scores.
- **VendorRepository**: Handles database interaction (CRUD operations for vendors and listings via Supabase).

## ⚙️ 4. Data Modeling in Supabase

### Tables
- `users` (linked to auth.uid, with role: 'user', 'vendor', 'admin')
- `products`
- `orders`
- `reviews`
- `disputes`
- `escrow`

### Performance Tips
- Use indexed fields for filtering and sorting (e.g., `created_at`, `status`, `user_id`).
- Avoid large joins; denormalize where necessary for performance (e.g., user profile summary in orders).
- Use views and policies to simplify permissions and queries.

---

## 🚀 5. Frontend Optimization

### Static and Incremental Static Regeneration
- Use `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` as appropriate.
- Use ISR for frequently updated vendor/product pages.

### Code Splitting
- Dynamically import components that are heavy or conditionally loaded.

### Shadcn & Tailwind Best Practices
- Avoid deeply nested components.
- Use utility-first classes from Tailwind to reduce unnecessary CSS.
- Use `clsx` or `classnames` to manage dynamic classes cleanly.

---

## 🔄 6. Realtime Features & Subscriptions

- Use Supabase Realtime for order status updates and admin notifications.
- Debounce real-time updates to reduce UI churn and flicker.
- Use SWR/React Query for efficient data fetching with cache revalidation.

---

## 📦 7. Escrow & Transaction Flow

### Workflow
1. Buyer places order -> funds sent to escrow.
2. Platform and farmer are notified.
3. Delivery completes -> buyer confirms.
4. Funds released from escrow to farmer.
5. If dispute, funds held until admin resolves.

### Best Practices
- Ensure all payments and state changes are atomic (transaction-safe operations).
- Use webhooks to monitor mobile money callbacks and update order statuses.

---

## 📈 8. Admin Panel

### Real-Time Dashboard
- Show active orders, disputes, farmer verifications.
- Use pagination + filtering (e.g., by status, date range).

### Performance Optimizations
- Preload metrics using Supabase functions or views.
- Cache admin queries for frequently accessed stats.

---

## 🧪 9. Testing & Quality

### Types of Testing
- **Unit Testing**: React components and Supabase logic using Vitest or Jest.
- **Integration Testing**: Form workflows, page routing.
- **E2E Testing**: Using Playwright or Cypress to simulate full transactions.

### Automation
- Use GitHub Actions or Vercel Preview Deployments with test suites.

---

## 🧰 10. Monitoring & Logging

### Tools
- Integrate tools like Sentry for error tracking.
- Use Supabase Logs for tracking queries and auth issues.
- Set up email/SMS alerts for failed transactions or dispute triggers.

---

## 📊 11. Scalability & Load Readiness

- Design database schema to scale to 10k+ users.
- Use Supabase rate limits and quotas mindfully.
- Leverage CDN (via Vercel) for asset and image delivery.
- Lazy-load large datasets (e.g., paginated product lists).

---

## ✅ Final Checklist Before Launch
- [ ] Role-based access is enforced and tested.
- [ ] Escrow logic tested with edge cases.
- [ ] Verified vendors and mobile money integration tested.
- [ ] Admin dispute flows complete and functioning.
- [ ] Performance testing completed (TTFB < 200ms, LCP < 2.5s).
