#### Improvements:
- ✅ Real data integration instead of hardcoded values
- ✅ Better loading and error states
- ✅ Improved search and filtering experience
- ✅ Enhanced empty states for better UX

### 5. **Shared Services and Utilities**

#### Created API Client:
- **`lib/api-client.ts`** - Centralized API client with:
  - Consistent error handling
  - Standardized response formats
  - Built-in authentication
  - File upload support
  - Helper functions for common patterns

#### Features:
- ✅ Centralized HTTP client
- ✅ Consistent error handling across the platform
- ✅ Type-safe API responses
- ✅ Built-in loading and error states

### 6. **Eliminated Redundancies**

#### Removed/Deprecated:
- **`components/common/header.tsx`** - Basic header (replaced with SiteHeader)
- **`components/admin/data-table.tsx`** - Now imports from shared ui component
- **Duplicate dashboard card components** - Replaced with reusable StatsCard

#### Consolidated:
- ✅ Multiple loading patterns into standardized components
- ✅ Various empty states into consistent components  
- ✅ Form patterns into reusable wrappers
- ✅ Table implementations into shared DataTable
