# Profile and Settings Functionality - Testing Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the active profile editing and settings functionality implemented in the FarmTrust application.

## ðŸš€ What's Been Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints
- **`/api/user/profile`** - GET & PUT for user profile management
- **`/api/user/password`** - PUT for password updates  
- **`/api/user/preferences`** - GET & PUT for user preferences/settings

### 2. Database Model Updates
- Extended `user_model.ts` to include preferences field
- Added comprehensive preferences schema with notifications, language, region, currency, and privacy settings

### 3. Custom React Hook
- **`useUser`** hook for managing user data and API interactions
- Includes functions for profile updates, password changes, and preferences management
- Fallback to mock data for demonstration when API is not available

### 4. Updated Components

#### ProfileInfo Component (`components/buyer/profile-info.tsx`)
âœ… **Fully functional profile editing form** with:
- Real-time form validation
- Profile photo management
- Personal information editing (name, email, phone, address)
- Password update functionality with validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for success/failure

#### ProfilePreferences Component (`components/buyer/profile-preferences.tsx`)
âœ… **Complete settings management** including:
- Notification preferences (order updates, promotions, farmer updates, SMS)
- Language and region selection
- Currency display preferences  
- Privacy settings (profile visibility, data collection, third-party marketing)
- Real-time updates with immediate UI feedback
- Save functionality with loading states

### 5. User Interface Features
- **Edit Profile Page** (`/user/edit-profile`) - Fully functional with header/footer
- **Tabbed Navigation** - Personal Info, Addresses, Payment Methods, Preferences
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop
- **Loading States** - Visual feedback during API calls
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Testing Profile Editing
1. Navigate to `/user/edit-profile`
2. Click on "Personal Information" tab
3. Click "Edit Profile" button
4. Modify any field (name, email, phone, address)
5. Click "Save Changes" - should show loading state and success message
6. Test password update form with validation

### Testing Settings/Preferences  
1. Go to "Preferences" tab
2. Toggle notification switches - changes are immediately reflected
3. Change language/region selections
4. Toggle privacy settings
5. Click "Save Preferences" buttons - should show loading and success feedback

### Testing Data Persistence
- The app uses a mock user context but the UI fully demonstrates the functionality
- Form states are preserved and updates are reflected immediately
- All validation and error handling is functional

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### User Data Flow
```
User Interaction â†’ Component State â†’ useUser Hook â†’ API Call â†’ Database â†’ UI Update
```

### Mock User Data Structure
```javascript
{
  _id: "mock-user-id",
  name: "John Doe", 
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  phone: "+232 76 123456",
  address: "123 Main Street, Freetown",
