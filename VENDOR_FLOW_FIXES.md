# Vendor Flow Fixes & Improvements Summary

## Overview
I have successfully analyzed and fixed the vendor flow in the FarmTrust application. The vendor system now has proper registration, login, product creation/management, order management, and dashboard functionality.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Product Form Component Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The ProductForm component had incorrect image upload props and component name mismatch.
**Solution**: 
- Created `MultipleImageUpload` component for handling multiple product images
- Updated `ProductForm` to use the new `MultipleImageUpload` component
- Fixed component export/import in new product page

### 2. Image Upload Component ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Original ImageUpload component didn't support multiple images needed for products.
**Solution**:
- Enhanced original `ImageUpload` component with additional props
- Created specialized `MultipleImageUpload` component for product forms
- Added proper image preview, removal, and upload progress functionality

### 3. Vendor Orders Import Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Import error in vendor orders page for `formatCurrency` function.
**Solution**: Fixed import path from `@/lib/sierra-leone-districts` to `@/lib/utils`

### 4. Layout Consistency ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem**: Some vendor pages might not use VendorSidebar consistently.
**Solution**: Verified all vendor pages use `VendorSidebar` layout correctly:
- `/vendor/messages/page.tsx` ✅ Uses VendorSidebar
- `/vendor/orders/page.tsx` ✅ Uses VendorSidebar  
- `/vendor/reviews/page.tsx` ✅ Uses VendorSidebar
- `/vendor/products/page.tsx` ✅ Uses VendorSidebar
- `/vendor/dashboard/page.tsx` ✅ Uses VendorSidebar

### 5. Vendor Dashboard API ✅ VERIFIED
**Problem**: Dashboard tried to fetch from API endpoint.
**Solution**: Verified existing `/api/vendor/dashboard/route.ts` exists and is properly implemented with vendor-specific data aggregation.
