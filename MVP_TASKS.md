# FarmTrust MVP Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the missing key features required to complete the FarmTrust MVP based on the current codebase analysis.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Already Implemented
- **Service Layer**: All 15 service files with comprehensive business logic
- **Repository Layer**: Complete data access layer for all models
- **Models**: Full Mongoose schema definitions for all entities
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library and domain-specific components

describe('Auth API', () => {
  test('POST /api/auth/login - success', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password' });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('user');
  });
});
```
