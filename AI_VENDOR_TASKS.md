## Notes for AI Implementation

1. **Database Considerations**: All queries must filter by vendor ID to ensure data isolation
2. **Real-time Features**: Consider using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live updates
3. **File Uploads**: Implement proper file validation and storage (suggest Cloudinary integration)
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Performance**: Cache frequently accessed data and optimize database queries
6. **Testing**: Write tests as you implement features, not after
7. **Documentation**: Document APIs and components as you build them

Each task should be implemented with proper error handling, input validation, authentication checks, and comprehensive testing.
